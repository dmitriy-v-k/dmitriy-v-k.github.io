Hi All! It's my first post in my new blog. 
After I've read some interesting ideas about OOP I've created my first repository on github and 
called [CSimplest]: https://github.com/dmitriy-v-k/dmitriy-v-k.github.io "CSimplest trueOOP Framework". It's "true-OOP" framework via C#.
In blog's pages I'll try write my things about OOP and my framework. 

I hope you will be interested!
